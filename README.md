## Compile
Submodules are not updated automatically: run `git submodule update --init` first.

To compile discord_presence plugin simply do `make` and `sudo make install`. For debug build, compile with `make DEBUG=1`.

## Troubleshooting

#### Plugin not working with discord installed through flatpak

Flatpak by default sandboxes applications which makes rich presence unavailable to other applications. To fix this issue look at this [wiki page](https://github.com/flathub/com.discordapp.Discord/wiki/Rich-Precense-(discord-rpc)).

### More information
This plugin uses `libdiscord-rpc` library. By running `make` it will automatically download discord-rpc library through submodule and it will be patched so the library is reallocable (`-fPIC`).
It will build`libdiscord-rpc` library and then move static library file (`libdiscord-rpc.a`) into the main directory. Plugin will be linked with this file.

To compile without building `libdiscord-rpc` run `make discord_presence`.
